# LVGLBuilder
A WIP fork of GUI Builder for littlevgl written in C++ and using LVGL for preview of the created GUI and Qt for the higher-level user interface for drag and drop of widgets as well as editing of properties and styles, using LVGL version 7.

![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CURTLab/LVGLBuilder/master/preview.png)

### Prerequisites
* [Qt 5.11+](https://www.qt.io/) - The Qt framework
* C++11
* LVGL 7.2.0 (included in source since a few adaptions are applied)

Tested:
 * Windows 7 + MinGW 7.x + Qt 5.14.0

### Build
Building with console:
* Move to the cloned LVGLBuild directory
* Run ```qmake LVGLBuilder.pro```
* For gcc (Mac/Linux): ```make```
* For mingw: ```mingw32-make```
* For windows: ```jom``` (make sure that jom.exe is in the environment path)

Building with QtCreator:
* Download Qt from https://www.qt.io/download-open-source
* Install Qt with QtCreator
* Open the LVGLBuilder.pro file with QtCreator
* Click build project
* There are no special requironments, therefor it should build with QtCreator out of the box. 

### Usage
 * Create a new project and select the screen resolution
 * Simply drag and drop widgets from the list into the canvas
 * Widgets can be moved with the arrow keys or by dragging
 * Lock widgets to prevent editing (Unlock via right click context menu)
 * Drop a widget into another widget to set the parent
 * Save and load a project as json file using the menu or tool buttons
 * Mark widgets within the property editor as accessable via the c header
 * Export the project as c code using the menu (File -> Export -> C Project ...)
